# Multi-Agent Orchestration Feature

## Overview
Implement a human-in-the-loop multi-agent system where users can observe and participate in collaborative AI conversations. This feature will demonstrate advanced Semantic Kernel orchestration capabilities through specialized agent teams working together on user-defined tasks.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Demonstrate multi-agent collaboration with human oversight
- Provide real-time visualization of agent deliberation processes
- Enable iterative refinement through human feedback loops
- Showcase different agent personality types and specializations

### Learning Outcomes
- Understand Semantic Kernel's GroupChatOrchestration
- Master multi-agent conversation management
- Implement custom chat managers and orchestration logic
- Handle complex state management across multiple AI entities

## In Scope

### Core Features
- **Multi-Agent Chat Interface**: Separate section in navigation for agent orchestration
- **Real-time Agent Deliberation**: Stream all agent-to-agent conversations to UI
- **Visual Agent Distinction**: Avatars, colors, and styling to differentiate speakers
- **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**: Clear prompts when user input is required
- **Predefined Agent Teams**: Start with CopyWriter + Reviewer team from SK example

### Technical Implementation
- New Razor component for multi-agent interface
- Agent abstraction layer and management service
- GroupChatOrchestration integration with SignalR
- Enhanced UI components for multi-speaker conversations
- Specialized message types for different interaction patterns

## Out of Scope (Future Phases)

### Deferred Features
- **Custom Agent Teams**: User-created agent configurations (Phase 3)
- **Persistence**: Multi-agent conversation storage (Phase 3)
- **Advanced Workflows**: Multiple orchestration patterns beyond human-in-the-loop (Phase 2.3)
- **Agent Memory**: Long-term agent state persistence
- **External Tool Integration**: Agents calling external APIs/services

### Technical Limitations
- No integration with existing single-agent chat persistence
- Limited to text-based interactions (no file uploads, images, etc.)
- No real-time collaboration between multiple human users

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 2.1: Foundation & Basic Multi-Agent Chat
**Objective**: Establish core multi-agent infrastructure without orchestration

**Tasks**:
- Create new "Agent Teams" section in navigation menu
- Build `MultiAgentChat.razor` component with distinct UI design
- Implement `AgentService` for managing multiple ChatCompletionAgents
- Create agent configuration models (name, description, instructions, styling)
- Add basic agent-to-agent conversation flow
- Implement visual distinction system (avatars, colors, message styling)
- Test with simple two-agent back-and-forth conversation

**Success Criteria**:
- User can navigate to Agent Teams section
- Two agents can have a conversation visible in real-time
- Each agent has distinct visual identity
- Messages stream in real-time via SignalR

### Phase 2.2: Human-in-the-Loop Orchestration
**Objective**: Add orchestration layer with human intervention points

**Tasks**:
- Integrate Semantic Kernel's GroupChatOrchestration
- Implement custom `HumanInTheLoopChatManager`
- Create orchestration workflow service
- Add "Human Input Required" message types to UI
- Implement user response handling and workflow continuation
- Add termination logic based on user satisfaction
- Create CopyWriter + Reviewer agent team configuration

**Success Criteria**:
- Agents collaborate on user-defined tasks
- System prompts user for input at appropriate decision points
- User can provide feedback to continue or terminate workflow
- Complete end-to-end CopyWriter/Reviewer workflow functions

### Phase 2.3: Enhanced UX & Multiple Workflows
**Objective**: Polish the experience and add workflow variety

**Tasks**:
- Add agent team selection (multiple predefined teams)
- Enhance UI with progress indicators and workflow status
- Implement different orchestration patterns (analyst/critic, researcher/fact-checker)
- Add workflow templates and task guidance
- Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

**Success Criteria**:
- Multiple agent team types available
- Smooth user experience with clear guidance
- Robust error handling for failed agent interactions
- Ready foundation for future custom agent team creation

## Technical Architecture

### New Components
- `Components/Pages/MultiAgentChat.razor`: Main orchestration interface
- `Services/AgentService.cs`: Multi-agent management and configuration
- `Services/OrchestrationService.cs`: Workflow and human-in-the-loop logic
- `Models/AgentConfiguration.cs`: Agent definition and styling models
- `Models/OrchestrationMessage.cs`: Enhanced message types for multi-agent scenarios
- `Hubs/OrchestrationHub.cs`: SignalR hub for multi-agent real-time communication

### Agent Team Configurations
**CopyWriter + Reviewer** (Phase 2.2):
- CopyWriter: Creative, brief, focused on single proposals
- Reviewer: Critical, David Ogilvy-inspired, approves or suggests refinements

**Future Teams** (Phase 2.3):
- Analyst + Critic: Problem-solving and evaluation
- Researcher + Fact-Checker: Information gathering and verification
- Idea Generator + Evaluator: Creative brainstorming and assessment

### Message Flow Architecture
```
User Input → OrchestrationService → Agent1 → Agent2 → Human Decision Point → Continue/Terminate
```

### UI/UX Design Principles
- **Transparency**: All agent deliberation visible to user
- **Clarity**: Clear indication of workflow state and next steps
- **Engagement**: User feels like active participant, not passive observer
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Easy to distinguish between agents, system messages, and user input requests

## Success Metrics
- User can successfully complete CopyWriter/Reviewer workflow
- Agent conversations stream in real-time without lag
- Human intervention points are clear and intuitive
- System gracefully handles workflow failures and edge cases
- Foundation ready for custom agent team creation in future phases

## Dependencies
- Semantic Kernel GroupChatOrchestration packages
- Enhanced SignalR message handling
- UI component library expansion for agent visualization
- Additional agent persona development and testing

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Complexity Risk**: Multi-agent systems can become unpredictable
  - *Mitigation*: Start simple, extensive testing, clear termination conditions
- **Performance Risk**: Multiple agents may slow response times
  - *Mitigation*: Optimize agent instructions, implement timeouts, monitor performance
- **UX Risk**: Multi-agent conversations could become confusing
  - *Mitigation*: Clear visual design, user testing, intuitive workflow guidance
